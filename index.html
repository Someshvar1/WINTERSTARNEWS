            <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The ministry said a scheme and a Mega Integrated Textile Region and Apparel (MITRA) Park, in over 1,000 acres of land with state-of-the-art infrastructure, common utilities and R & D lab, are under consideration.

So far, 59 textile parks have been sanctioned under the Scheme for Integrated Textile Parks, out of which 22 have been completed.

The ministry also stated that it is developing an e-commerce platform through Digital India Corporation, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, to provide direct marketing platform to the handicraft artisans.

“In the first phase, the artisans/weavers from 205 handicrafts/handlooms clusters are being selected throughout the country for uploading the handicrafts/handlooms product on portal,” the ministry said in its Year-End Review.

                During the calendar year 2020, the Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) has made a record procurement of around 151 lakh bales under minimum support price (MSP) operations, around 290 per cent higher as against the procurement of 38.43 lakh bales a year ago, it said.</p>

            <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Good news for Pune residents! BRTS service on Swargate-Katraj route to resume from 2021. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) is all set to resume the Bus Rapid Transit System service on the 5.4 kilometre long route from January 1 onwards, four years after it discontinued the pilot BRTS route from Swargate to Katraj on Pune-Satara road for the development of two flyovers and subways. The PMC took the Swargate-Katraj route as a pilot project, even as the Corporation faced various hurdles from its conception till its completion in 2006-2007, according to an IE report. While taking up the construction of two flyovers as well as two subways on the road, the PMC had decided to redesign the BRTS route at a cost of Rs 70 crore.

According to the report, this included road widening in order to create separate lanes for private vehicles, as the flow of traffic had increased on the stretch. In a bid to ensure that there are no problems in resuming the BRTS service on the stretch, the PMC has carried out a safety audit of the road. Mayor Murlidhar Mohol was quoted in the report saying that the redeveloping work of the BRTS route from Swargate to Katraj was taken up in the year 2016, but the work had gotten delayed due to technical problems. Now, the redeveloping work on this stretch will be finished in the next three days and directions have been given to resume the BRTS service on the Swargate-Katraj route from January 1, Mohol added.</p>

"However, international scheduled flights may be allowed on selected routes by the competent authority on a case-to-case basis," the Directorate General of Civil Aviation added.
Scheduled international passenger services have been suspended in India since March 23 due to the coronavirus pandemic. But special international flights have been operating under the Vande Bharat Mission since May and under bilateral "air bubble" arrangements with selected countries since July.
India has formed air bubble pacts with 24 countries including the US, the UK, the UAE, Kenya, Bhutan and France. Under an air bubble pact between two countries, special international flights can be operated by their airlines between their territories.The DGCA circular also said that the suspension does not affect the operation of international all-cargo operations and flights specifically approved by it.

International Flights Latest Updates: Air India to Start New Services to US From January </h4>

            <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">International Flights Latest Updates: As the year 2020 is coming to an end in few days, Air India on Tuesday announced that it will start new services to the US from January in 2021. Issuing a statement, the airline stated that the first-ever non-stop services between Bengaluru and San Francisco as well as between Hyderabad and Chicago will start from January 9 and 13 next year, respectively.“Passengers from Bengaluru and Hyderabad – both gateways to South India – will enjoy huge benefits travelling to San Francisco and Chicago as this will enable faster and easier connections,” the airline said in a statement.Notably, Air India at present operates non-stop flights from Delhi to New York, Newark, Washington, San Francisco and Chicago and from Mumbai to Newark.With the announcement of the plans, Air India has put in competition with United and American, who plan to fly similar routes next year.

While this year has mostly seen reductions in Air India’s schedule, new plan is expected to grow the traffic. The two new routes are strategic choices by Air India, tapping into new markets and beating out the competition.

With no direct flights to any US city, including New York, the Hyderabad-Chicago is a notably unserved market. This makes a direct route a lucrative one for Air India, allowing it to carry much of the US-bound traffic from the city. On the other hand, the Chicago is also home to the second-largest Indian-American community in the country, making it a strong VFR (visiting family and relatives) destination.</p>

            <img src="e1.jpeg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
            <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">In an effort to be more environmentally responsible, LEGO have said they aim to stop manufacturing bricks made of plastic resin and are considering other options, which could include hemp. According to Telegraph World, the company makes 60 billion blocks a year. While LEGO want to replace the harmful plastic used in their products, they also require the new material to meet the high standards that allow the blocks to work as they always have, especially with the effective �𦣇licking�� together is a key aspect of the iconic coloured block.The Lego shapes will alternatively be made from plant-based materials in an attempt to reduce plastic waste.

The Danish company are set to release their new eco-friendly line consisting of 25 various brick shapes that will resemble nature-inspired products.

They will be made out of polyethylene, which is made from sugar cane, and are set to be rolled out in Lego box sets later this year. However, the toy manufacturer admits that this material is not strong enough to make regular Lego pieces.

Lego are investing 1 billion kroner and hiring around 100 people to ensure that its promise is fulfilled.

Lego said: “Resources should be sourced and used responsibly, so they will still benefit future generations. We are constantly in pursuit of more sustainable solutions to our raw materials consumption and our packaging.”

Tim Brooks, Vice President of environmental responsibility at Lego, said: “At Lego, we want to make a positive impact on the world around us, and we are working hard to make great play products for children using sustainable materials. This is a great first step in our ambitious commitment of making all Lego bricks using sustainable material.”

Lego have also committed to reducing carbon emissions by promising 100 per cent renewable energy by 2020 and they are aiming for a carbon neutral supply chain. They are also promoting recycling by encouraging families to recycle or donate unwanted Lego bricks.</p>

            <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">New Delhi: In the new year, the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) will put in place a unified portal that will list the status of all clearances sought by the developer of any infrastructure project, including wildlife and forest consents, and coastal zone regulation.Developers will have to fill one form for all clearances and submit uniform information based on which the environmental impact of the project will be assessed by the panels, environment ministry secretary RP Gupta said.

“Our approvals shouldn’t be a hindrance to any infrastructure or development project. It should be approved quickly or disapproved at the earliest. This is part of the reforms we are bringing in for ease of doing business. The portal will be up by mid-next year and will be of great benefit to us and to project proponents,” Gupta said.

A policy is also being drafted to ensure the monitoring of projects that are granted clearances.The move to improve the ease of doing business for infrastructure developers follows guidelines issued by the ministry last month to accelerate the grant of clearances associated with the environmental footprint of any project, attempting to speed up project implementation to counter the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy.

In an office memorandum (OM), the ministry said all meetings to consider green clearances should be held at least twice a month to reduce the time taken for grant of approval. Acceptance process for an application should be limited to just checking if all relevant documents have been submitted and terms of reference covered, according to the OM, a copy of which has been seen by HT.

All projects placed on the agenda should be considered by an expert appraisal committee even if project representatives are absent. Only if project representatives do not attend meetings for over six months will the member-secretary of an EAC write to the regional office of the environment ministry to check the on-ground status.</p>

He is the first recipient of the iconic medal which is named after former Australian skipper and cricket Johnny Mullagh. Rahane scored 112 runs in the first innings and helped India reach a total of 326 runs in the first innings.In a bid to pay tribute to the ex-cricketer, Cricket Australia had earlier announced that the Player of the match of the Boxing Day Test will be awarded, Mullagh Medal. Mullagh was the first cricketer who led the famous 1868 Aboriginal cricket tour of England.India bounced back from their 8-wicket defeat in Adelaide to post a 8-wicket victory in the 2nd Test at the MCG on Tuesday, drawing the Test series level at 1-1. Missing star players, like their regular skipper Virat Kohli, and having suffered such a demoralizing defeat recently, India’s win at the MCG is being hailed as a ‘historic’ win.</p>

            <h4>Sports in 2020: A reminder of why nostalgia is a good thing, maybe the best of things
</h4>
            <img src="https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/152731-aydmxjdrng-1609356951.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
            <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The year 2020 was meant to be a significant one for athletes around the world, across disciplines. Sure, every year and every event is important when you are a professional sportsperson. But this was meant to be the year of two T20 World Cups, a European football championship, and the biggest of them all: the Tokyo Olympic Games. And the regular seasons of events that would go along with these.

By extension, it was meant to be one of the busiest times in the lives of those covering these events as well. At the beginning of the year, it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say plans were being made in newsrooms across the world to prepare for this cycle of events.

And then, ironically in a month named March, things started coming to a halt.

One event after another was getting cancelled, becoming near impossible to even keep up at one point. Live sport vanished from our living rooms. It did not take long to realise that it would be at least months before we see the return of sport, and even then it wouldn’t be anything close to normal.Soon enough, nostalgia took centrestage. Sport is all about action and reaction, so it would actually not be an exaggeration to say that things got busier when there was no live sport to react to.

At Scroll.in, we got ourselves busy with a series of reports that would keep the website going. We kicked off The Field’s Rewind Series to revisit iconic moments from the world of sport, documented stories of succeeding against odds in How Sport Inspires because athletes are often a great source of life lessons. And then there was the Heroes Of The Sporting World series to highlight work of some who do not usually enjoy the limelight when live action is on constantly in our televisions.

Personally, one of the exercises that truly drove home how important sporting memories of the past are, was talking to fans across generations to find out what the 1983 World Cup win by Kapil Dev and Co meant to them. It was a reminder of why sports nostalgia, when done with the right perspectives, can be a life-affirming feeling.

Elsewhere, re-runs started dominating air-time. Great matches were “live blogged” again. athletes started interviewing each other remotely to give us great anecdotes with unprecedented candour, almost as if talking with their peers from the confines of their rooms, instead of facing the cameras and microphones, helped them open up like we rarely see.
