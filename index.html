Pierre Cardin, as the genius the world knew in the swinging 60s, and we in the 70s and 80s, was a licensing king, way ahead of his time. He initiated product diversification from home furnishings, to writing instruments.I vividly recall seeing his show in 1994, at Hauz Khas Village, a first for an international brand. In fact, for many of us, he was our first introduction to international fashion. The visionary, will be missed for his eye on the future, without forgetting his past.Pierre Cardin, was an Italian-born naturalised-French fashion designer. He is known for what were his avant-garde style and Space Age designs. He preferred geometric shapes and motifs, often ignoring the female form. He advanced into unisex fashions, sometimes experimental, and not always practical.</p>

            <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">New Delhi, Dec 29 (PTI) Samples of all international passengers who arrived in India from December 9 to 22 and tested positive for COVID-19 will be subjected to genome sequencing as part of the Centre''s strategy to detect the mutated coronavirus strain that has emerged in the United Kingdom recently.

Others will be followed up by the state and district surveillance officers, and will be tested as per ICMR guidelines, even if asymptomatic, between fifth and 10th day of arrival, according to the Union Health Ministry''s guidance document on genomic sequencing.

"All the international passengers who have arrived in India during the last 14 days (from December 9 to 22), if symptomatic and tested positive, will be subjected to genome sequencing," the document stated.

According to the Airports Authority of India (AAI), there were a total of 10.44 lakh international passengers who travelled to and from India in November this year.

The presence of the new UK variant of the coronavirus has already been reported by Denmark, the Netherlands, Australia, Italy, Sweden, France, Spain, Switzerland, Germany, Canada, Japan, Lebanon and Singapore so far.

The health ministry has established the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) for laboratory and epidemiological surveillance and to expand the whole genome sequencing of the coronavirus in the country, aiding in the understanding of how the virus spreads and evolves.

India has put in place a proactive and preventive strategy to detect and contain the mutant variant of the virus. It includes temporary suspension of all flights coming from the UK with effect from the midnight of December 23 till December 31 and mandatory testing of all UK returnee air passengers through RT-PCR test.

Ten regional laboratories have been identified by the Centre where states will send five per cent of their COVID-19 positive samples for genome sequencing to detect the new coronavirus variant.

Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Epidemiological Surveillance and Response in the context of new variant of SARS-CoV-2 has already been issued by the Health Ministry.

The purpose of this initiative is to ensure proper screening of international travellers arriving in India for early detection of new SAR-CoV-2 variant cases.

Further, epidemiological surveillance of the passengers, who have arrived in India since November 23, will be conducted in the community through active follow up.

Six people who returned to India from the United Kingdom have tested positive for the new mutated strain of coronavirus, the Union Health Ministry said on Tuesday.

It said the UK variant genome of SARS-CoV-2 was detected in three samples in the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences Hospital (NIMHANS) Bengaluru, two in the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB in Hyderabad and one in the National Institute of Virology (NIV) Pune.

All these people have been kept in single room isolation at designated health care facilities by respective state governments and their close contacts have also been put under quarantine, the ministry said. PTI PLB DSP NSD NSD</p>

            <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">In an effort to be more environmentally responsible, LEGO have said they aim to stop manufacturing bricks made of plastic resin and are considering other options, which could include hemp. According to Telegraph World, the company makes 60 billion blocks a year. While LEGO want to replace the harmful plastic used in their products, they also require the new material to meet the high standards that allow the blocks to work as they always have, especially with the effective �𦣇licking�� together is a key aspect of the iconic coloured block.The Lego shapes will alternatively be made from plant-based materials in an attempt to reduce plastic waste.

The Danish company are set to release their new eco-friendly line consisting of 25 various brick shapes that will resemble nature-inspired products.

They will be made out of polyethylene, which is made from sugar cane, and are set to be rolled out in Lego box sets later this year. However, the toy manufacturer admits that this material is not strong enough to make regular Lego pieces.

Lego are investing 1 billion kroner and hiring around 100 people to ensure that its promise is fulfilled.

Lego said: “Resources should be sourced and used responsibly, so they will still benefit future generations. We are constantly in pursuit of more sustainable solutions to our raw materials consumption and our packaging.”

Tim Brooks, Vice President of environmental responsibility at Lego, said: “At Lego, we want to make a positive impact on the world around us, and we are working hard to make great play products for children using sustainable materials. This is a great first step in our ambitious commitment of making all Lego bricks using sustainable material.”

Lego have also committed to reducing carbon emissions by promising 100 per cent renewable energy by 2020 and they are aiming for a carbon neutral supply chain. They are also promoting recycling by encouraging families to recycle or donate unwanted Lego bricks.</p>

            <h4>Amazon deforestation and fires show the summer of 2019 not normal year</h4>
            <img src="e3.jpeg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
            <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The perceived scale of the Amazon blazes received global attention this summer. However, international concerns raised at the time were countered by the Brazilian Government, which claimed the fire situation in August was 'normal' and 'below the historical average'.An international team of scientists writing in the journal Global Change Biology say the number of active fires in August was actually three times higher than in 2018 and the highest number since 2010.The Amazon rainforest is the largest rainforest in the world, covering an area of 5,500,000 km2 (2,100,000 sq mi). It represents over half of the planet's rainforests, and comprises the largest and most biodiverse tract of tropical rainforest in the world. This region includes territory belonging to nine nations. The majority of the forest is contained within Brazil, with 60%, followed by Peru with 13%, Colombia with 10%, and with minor amounts in Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, Guyana, Suriname and France (French Guiana).

The cattle sector of the Brazilian Amazon, incentivized by the international beef and leather trades,[1] has been responsible for about 80% of all deforestation in the region,[2][3] or about 14% of the world's total annual deforestation, making it the world's largest single driver of deforestation.[4] The vast majority of agricultural activity resulting in deforestation was subsidized by government tax revenue.[5] By 1995, 70% of formerly forested land in the Amazon, and 91% of land deforested since 1970 had been converted to cattle ranching.[6][7] Much of the remaining deforestation within the Amazon has resulted from farmers clearing land (sometimes using the slash-and-burn method) for small-scale subsistence agriculture[8] or mechanized cropland producing soy, palm, and other crops.[9]

More than one-third of the Amazon forest belongs to more than 3,344 formally acknowledged indigenous territories. Until 2015, only 8% of Amazonian deforestation occurred in forests inhabited by indigenous peoples, while 88% of occurred in the less than 50% of the Amazon area that is neither indigenous territory nor protected area. Historically, the livelihoods of indigenous Amazonian peoples have depended on the forest for food, shelter, water, fibre, fuel and medicines. The forest is also interconnected with their identity and cosmology. For this reason the deforestation rates are lower in indigenous territories, despite pressures encouraging deforestation being stronger.[10]</p>

He is the first recipient of the iconic medal which is named after former Australian skipper and cricket Johnny Mullagh. Rahane scored 112 runs in the first innings and helped India reach a total of 326 runs in the first innings.In a bid to pay tribute to the ex-cricketer, Cricket Australia had earlier announced that the Player of the match of the Boxing Day Test will be awarded, Mullagh Medal. Mullagh was the first cricketer who led the famous 1868 Aboriginal cricket tour of England.India bounced back from their 8-wicket defeat in Adelaide to post a 8-wicket victory in the 2nd Test at the MCG on Tuesday, drawing the Test series level at 1-1. Missing star players, like their regular skipper Virat Kohli, and having suffered such a demoralizing defeat recently, India’s win at the MCG is being hailed as a ‘historic’ win.</p>

            <h4>FA and RFU lead calls to get grassroots sport and fans back 'as soon as possible'
</h4>

            <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">More than 50 leading British sports bodies have called for a new government action plan to help grassroots survive and thrive amid the Covid-19 crisis, including a commitment to getting people playing and watching sport again “as soon as possible” even in tier 3 and 4 areas.

The letter, signed by the Football Association, the Rugby Football Union and the England and Wales Cricket Board, among others, also urges the government to support a “new year’s resolution” to put activity at the heart of the nation’s recovery from Covid-19 in 2021.While praising the government for its support of elite sport, the letter asks it to do more for community sport and activity “in the higher tiers of restrictions to ensure people can get back to participating in what they love as soon as possible”.

“We all share an absolute focus for sport and physical activity to be at the heart of our nation’s post-Covid renewal in 2021 and beyond, helping everyone to get fitter and healthier,” it adds. “This means making plans for supporters to return to full stadia and people to return to their grassroots facilities as soon as possible, creating the income needed to reinvest into these communities.”

The message is the latest salvo from the Save Our Sports campaign, which is warning that much of the sport and activity sector – which employs nearly 600,000 people in the UK and contributes £16bn to the economy annually – will struggle to recover from a long period in tier 4.

Huw Edwards, the chief executive of UK Active which represents more than 4,000 gyms, pools and leisure centres, said he hoped it would be possible to reopen facilities sooner rather than later. But if that wasn’t the case, the government had to find other ways to help the sector.

“We recognise this is a new chapter in the virus with the new variant, but there needs to be a plan to support the physical and mental wellbeing of the nation during the winter months,” he told the Guardian.

“Of course every sector in the country is struggling – but at least retail has online, and food has takeaways. When you close gyms, pools and leisure centres, their income goes to zero. And thousands of jobs will be lost as a result.”
